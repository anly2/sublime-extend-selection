Version 1.1.1 of the ExtendSelection plugin

This version adds a feature that combines 'selection events' in order to handle drag-selections.
Previously, using the mouse to drag-select was not handled by the plugin. Now it is.
However, you may consider the sideffect 'unwanted'.

(as described in the README.md)

**Example of possibly 'unwanted' behaviour**

 >   selection at `row 10 column 2`  
 >   trigger `ExtendSelection` (<kbd>alt+shift+m</kbd>)  
 >   drag-select from `row 15 column 5` to `row 15 column 20`  
 >   <kbd>shift+right</kbd>  
 >   **This will add to the last selection, INSTEAD OF doing <kbd>shift+right</kbd> for EVERY selection**

Please beware of this and disable the feature through the settings if that behaviour is undesired.

Also, any feedback and bug reports are appreaciated.
