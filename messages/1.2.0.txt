Version 1.2.0 of the ExtendSelection plugin

This version adds a feature that allows the command to stay active even after the first handled selection.
This is achieved by delaying the completion of the command for a specified amount of time. Each selection change refreshes the timeout.
The timeout can be changed through the setting 'active_until_timeout'. By default it is set to 0 which effectively disables this new behaviour.

If you believe this feature would be useful to you, enable it by setting 'active_until_timeout' to some number in milliseconds. Low delays (about 500ms) are recommended.
